### Internationally, the importance of Clean Air has recently been recognized and legislated for. On 28 July, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which declared access to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment to be a universal human right.

### Good air quality is essential for our health as particles in the air can damage our lungs, hearts, and brains and cause a host of other health problems.

### In this project, I explored the World Health Organization's Global Pollution Dataset (2021). I looked at:
- Where and when most of the data were collected
- The timeline development of the concentration of the different pollutants
- Distribution of measurement concentrations
- Correlation between the concentration of the different pollutants
- Regional concentrations and regional time-line development of the pollutants
- The 10 cities which had the highest average concentrations of the different pollutants
