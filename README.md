# Exploratory Analysis of Global Air Pollution Dataset (WHO)

### With every breath we take, we suck in tiny particles that can damage our lungs, hearts, and brains and cause a host of other health problems.

### Dataset: Data downloaded from WHO. (https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/who-air-quality-database)

#### The WHO Ambient Air Quality Database compiles data on ground measurements of annual mean concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter of a diameter equal or smaller than 10 μm (PM10) or equal or smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) which aim at representing an average for the city or town as a whole, rather than for individual stations. Both groups of pollutants originate mainly from human activities related to fossil fuel combustion.

#### Pollutants:

#### Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) PM is a common proxy indicator for air pollution. There is strong evidence for the negative health impacts associated with exposure to this pollutant. The major components of PM are sulfates, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust and water.

#### Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) NO2 is a gas that is commonly released from the combustion of fuels in the transportation and industrial sectors.

#### Temporal Coverage:

#### The temporal coverage represents the number of days per year covered by measurements or any alternative qualification as provided in the original sources. If data from several monitoring stations in one city were available, their average temporal coverage was used for the city average.
